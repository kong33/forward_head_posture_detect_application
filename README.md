# 🧍 Forward Head Posture Detection Web Application


## 📌 Overview

Traditional posture correction systems rely on side-angle camera setups, <br/>
requiring no additional devices or physical space adjustments.

This web application estimates forward head posture using only a **front-facing webcam**,<br/>
allowing users to measure posture seamlessly during everyday computer use —
without extra hardware.

- Real-time body landmark extraction using **MediaPipe Pose Landmarker**
- Client-side posture analysis built with **Next.js**
- 3D visualization of averaged posture using **Three.js**

## ⚙️ Core Implementation

# 🔐 Focusing on Security

This project processes user health-related data.  
To minimize security risks and protect sensitive information, we implemented the following strategies:

---

### 1️⃣ Local Storage Strategy — IndexedDB

Regularly collected posture data is stored in **IndexedDB on the client side** instead of being continuously transmitted to the server.

This approach:

- Reduces exposure to network-based interception (e.g., MITM attacks)
- Minimizes unnecessary data transmission up to 90%
- Limits server-side accumulation of sensitive health data
- Enhances privacy by keeping raw measurement data on-device
- Hardly being influcned by network disconnection.

Only essential or aggregated data is persisted to the backend when necessary.

---

### 2️⃣ Full-Stack Architecture with Next.js

We adopted **Next.js as a full-stack framework** to unify frontend and backend logic within a single controlled environment.

This provides:

- Reduced attack surface by avoiding publicly exposed REST endpoints
- Server-only execution of database logic
- Clear separation between client and server components
- Centralized routing and middleware handling
- Easier enforcement of authentication and authorization rules

By consolidating the stack, we minimized configuration inconsistencies and improved maintainability.

---

### 3️⃣ Server Actions & Zod Validation

We utilized **Next.js Server Actions** to handle mutations securely on the server side.

Benefits include:

- Sensitive logic never exposed to the client bundle
- Direct server execution without separate API endpoints
- Strong type safety between client and server

Additionally, we integrated **Zod schema validation** to:

- Enforce strict input validation
- Prevent malformed or malicious payloads
- Ensure runtime data integrity beyond TypeScript's compile-time checks

# 🔒 Backend & API Architecture

## 🚀Type-Safe API Layer
Constructed robust APIs using Next.js Server Actions, strictly validating client payloads via **Zod** to ensure runtime safety.
```ts
//actions/summaryActions.ts
const PostDailySummarySchema = z.object({
  dateISO: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/, "wrong date formation"),
  sumWeighted: z.number().refine(Number.isFinite),
  weightSeconds: z.number().refine((n) => Number.isFinite(n) && n > 0),
  count: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

export type PostDailySummaryInput = z.infer<typeof PostDailySummarySchema>;

export async function postDailySummaryAction(_prevState: ActionState<unknown>, data: PostDailySummaryInput) {
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session?.user?.id) {
    return { ok: false, status: 401, message: SERVER_MESSAGES.AUTH_REQUIRED } as const;
  }

  const parsed = PostDailySummarySchema.safeParse(data);
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return { ok: false, status: 400, message: SERVER_MESSAGES.SYSTEM_MESSAGES } as const;
  }

  try {
    const result = await upsertDailySummary({
      ...parsed.data,
      userId: session.user.id,
    });
    revalidateTag("daily_summary");

    return { ok: true, data: result } as const;
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    logger.error("[postDailySummaryAction] Error:", error);
    return { ok: false, status: 500, message: SERVER_MESSAGES.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR } as const;
  }
}

```

## Why We Used Next.js Server Actions

1. **Eliminated Separate API Layer**  
   Reduced complexity by removing the need for dedicated REST endpoints.

2. **End-to-End Type Safety**  
   Shared TypeScript types between client and server without manual request/response contracts.

3. **Smaller Client Bundle Size**  
   Database logic stays on the server, preventing unnecessary client-side code bloat.

4. **Improved Security**  
   Sensitive logic and database access are never exposed to the browser.

5. **Seamless React Integration**  
   Works natively with React Server Components, Suspense, and streaming.

6. **Built-in Caching & Revalidation**  
   Leveraged `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` for automatic cache invalidation without external libraries. ( No need to add caching library like TQ )

## 🚀Robust Social System
Implemented scalable friendship management ensuring data consistency and integrity using Prisma `$transaction`.

```ts
// friends.service.ts
  return prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const updated = await tx.friendRequest.update({
      where: { id: requestId },
      data: { status: "ACCEPTED", respondedAt: new Date() },
      select: { id: true, status: true, respondedAt: true, fromUserId: true, toUserId: true },
    });
  ```
  ---
  
## 🚀Enterprise-level Error Handling
Integrated a centralized logging utility with **Sentry**, providing context-aware error tracking and i18n-ready, <br/>
user-friendly error messages while securing sensitive stack traces in production.

error message that developers see:
```ts
return json({ error: "UNAUTHORIZED" }, 401);
```
error message that users see:
```ts
  FRIEND_NOT_FOUND: {
    ko: "아직 저희 서비스를 이용하지 않는 친구 같아요. 이 기회에 초대해 보는 건 어떨까요? 💌",
    en: "It looks like your friend hasn't joined us yet. Why not invite them? 💌",
  },
```
